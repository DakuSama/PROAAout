project etudiant
This project was one of my second-year exams. I was tasked with creating a mobile game prototype that could be launched on Android. The prototype had to be developed using placeholder visual components. It needed to feature a very simple gameplay mechanic, with a strong focus on clarity, feedback readability, and interface design, as well as ease of use with touch controls. I was also required to integrate AI into the prototype using behavior trees.

I was the sole developer for this project, so all the code was written by me. The music used is royalty-free. The sound effects (SFX) were created by me using Chiptone. The joystick was sourced from Unity's Asset Store, and the rest of the assets consist of placeholders.
